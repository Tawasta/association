===============================
Membership Update Member Status
===============================

Manually updates membership status.

This is required if you invoice partners with products that are supposed
to be membership products but aren't at the time of invoice validation.

The module will go through ALL invoices and compare their products to
partner membership statuses, and update if necessary.

The update button will be added to the company settings.
